 What is Loren Ipsun

 </h4>

 <p>
 Loren Ipsun is simpy dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Loren Ipsum has been the industry s¨standrad rummy ever since the 1500s,when an unknow printer took a gally of type and sscrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the relase of Letraset sheets containing Loren Ipsum passages,and more recently with deskopt publishing software like Alduss PaageMaker including verions of Loren Ipsum

 Why do we use it?
 </h4>
 <p>
 It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readble content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,as opposed to using"Content her, content here", making it look like readable english. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Loren Ipsum as their default model tex, and a search for "lorem ipsum" will uncoven many web sites still in their infanc. Various versions have evolved over the years,sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
